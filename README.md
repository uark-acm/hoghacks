This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is the new website created to allow for more customization and history. While it may pertain to a certain theme for specific hackathons (like the one it was built for), the underlying code and other features should be transferable. This means that more work may need to be done for the website to be updated, but if any questions arise or a rewrite is in order, please contact Alex Prosser at alexprosser07@gmail.com. 

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uark-acm/hoghacks.git
