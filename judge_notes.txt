innovation and creativity: (weight - 7 points)
    - 1: Product doesn't build upon, but rather copies and mimics already existing products with little to no changes
        - Products rated as such should be a very obvious copy of something else with little to no changes (Threads to Twitter/X)
    - 2: Product builds upon other products/ideas minimally, but adds a feature that could be a selling point
        - Products rated as such can have a unique feature, but most ideas come from something else (Facebook, but for dogs)
    - 3: Product's ideas are implemented elsewhere, but adds enough features to still be called its own 
        - Products rated as such should be able to be compared to something else, but with enough features to distinguish it (BeReal to Instagram)
    - 4: Product is a new idea built on top of existing products or other ideas 
        - Products rated as such have a lot more ideas/features that are unique to itself, rather than repacking features from other products
    - 5: Product takes a new path where not much overlap of other products exist and delivers with new ideas or creative florishes
        - Products rated as such should be able to stand on it's own with almost no comparisons (features can still be compared, but not entire product)

technical implementation: (weight - 8 points)
    - 1: Product lacks any complex or well-thought out features and can be implemented trivially
        - Products rated as such can be compared to a beginning programming project (text app with <5 inputs)
    - 2: Product has some ideas and complexity, but is a bit lacking in either implementation or direction
        - Products rated as such have ideas glued together that doesn't mesh well
    - 3: Products has many ideas that could have potential, but current implementation needs more
        - Products rated as such has good ideas, but need more time in the "oven" to be fully realized
    - 4: Product has a feature or two that shows the complexity of the project without need for further development
        - Products rated as such might have a lacking feature in one area, but another feature that is ready to go
    - 5: Product has many features that a.) took plenty of effort to implement, or b.) doesn't need much expansion for a full product
        - Products rated as such should make you think "How was this created in 24 hours?" 

problem identification and connection to the theme: (weight - 5 points)
    - 1: Product doesn't solve any problem and doesn't have an establish connection to the theme
        - Products rated as such shouldn't be useful and connected to the theme
    - 2: Product is loosely connected to the theme or solves a trivial problem that shouldn't need a product
        - Products rated as such should have some merit, but doesn't seem useful in the grand scheme of technology
    - 3: Product is connected to the theme and solves a problem that may not be unique
        - Products rated as such have both properties, but doesn't excel in either
    - 4: Product identifies a unique problem related to the them, but may not solve it completely
        - Products rated as such may find a complicated problem, but may faulter in it's execution  
    - 5: Product identifies a unique problem related to the theme and solves it to it's fullest extent
        - Products rated as such solves a complicated problem to the theme that hasn't been solved before

presentation: (weight - 6 points)
    - 1: Product's presentation is confusing or unclear on what the product does
        - Products rated as such should have a presentation that is a slog to get through and you have no idea what the product does
    - 2: Product's presentation talks about the product enough to get the point across, but not much more
        - Products rated as such have a presentation that is understandable, but thats about it
    - 3: Product's presentation demonstrates the product well, but doesn't provide other context
        - Products rated as such are a good demo, but doesn't explain anything about problem statement or "the why"
    - 4: Product's presentation has a good demonstration and states why the product exists
        - Products rated as such have good presentations, but doesn't have that creativity factor involved
    - 5: Product's presentation makes it creatively clear on what the product does, what problem it fixes, and why it should matter
        - Products rated as such have a clear intention and the presentation quality and creativity is excellent
